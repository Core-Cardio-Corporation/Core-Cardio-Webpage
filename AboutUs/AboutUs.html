            As <b>Core Cardio Corporation</b>, we focus on informing college students about their heart health and how to prevent situations 
            that could endager their lives. Many people, including College Students don't know how dangerous a Cardiac Arrest is, and many
            College students are either unaware of what to do, or know what to do, but aren't confident enought to try to save someone's life.
            We are here to support anyone through the process of CPR with a simple, 2-minute video with NFL Player, Justin Reid. We were able to
            produce this video with the help of the JReid Indeed Foundation, American Heart Association, and support from other people.
            As a team, we used our strengths and weaknesses to build this website, video and other projects, to help college students
            as much as possible.
