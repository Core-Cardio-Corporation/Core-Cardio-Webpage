                    We are a mission-driven, not-for-profit organization committed to spreading life-saving CPR
                    knowledge to college students and communities worldwide.<br><br>

                    In a world where every second counts, we believe that everyone—regardless of background, age, or
                    experience—should be equipped with the power to act in a cardiac emergency.<br><br>

                    Our goal is simple but urgent: <strong>Make CPR education accessible, engaging, and
                        unforgettable.</strong><br>
                    Through hands-on events, digital outreach, and community-driven initiatives, we're building a
                    generation that doesn’t hesitate—<strong>a generation that knows how to save lives.</strong><br><br>

                    Because CPR isn't just a skill. <strong>It's a responsibility. It's empowerment. It's
                        action.</strong>

                    Working alongside the <strong>American Heart Association</strong> through our collaboration with
                    <strong>JReid InDeed</strong>, we took an extensive dive into the life-saving steps of
                    CPR.<br><br>

                    Through hands-on instruction, expert guidance, and real-world scenarios, we gained the confidence to
                    act in critical moments.<br><br>

                    One of the most moving parts of the session?<br>
                    <strong>Hearing the story of a cardiac arrest survivor whose life was saved thanks to quick
                        CPR.</strong><br><br>

                    It reminded us all: CPR is more than a skill—<strong>it’s a chance to be someone’s miracle.</strong>

                <div class="research-info">
                    After talking with the <strong>American Heart Association</strong> and conducting our own research
                    we
                    learned many important facts about cardiac arrest and CPR.<br><br>
                    These included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heavy Drinking is linked to a number of poor health
                            outcomes,
                            including heart disease.•*</li><br>

                        <li>Problems with the heart can occur at any age.*</li><br>

                        <li>College students having to adapt to new environments and routines, like lack of sleep and
                            exercise
                            and poor diet can lead to higher chances of heart disease.*</li><br>

                        <li>Studies show that the excessive drinking, nicotine use, stress and lack of fitness affects
                            their heart heavily.*</li><br>

                        <li>Many college students face social pressure from thinking that they have to party, and have
                            to look cool, especially if you go to a college that's known for "partying".• </li><br>

                    </ul>

                    These key points bring a lot about cardiac arrest into the light and should be known by
                    everyone. This information helped us figure out what was important to note and reference in our
                    film. It gave us key insight on what to reference to catch college students attention and how
                    cardiac arrest can effect everyone.<br><br>
